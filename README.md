# SomeCardGames

###**Short Description**

Built with Visual Studio, Some Card Games is a C# application with the power of the .net framework behind it, that allows you to play a few card games.

###**Development Versions**

Release versions are not availible currently, but if you desperatly want to see where I am at in developing this, you can compile it yourself and see. However, due to security reasons I removed the ErrorReporter.cs file, which contained sensetive information. If you are compiling it yourself, then you will need to remove all references to that file. The program will work fine without it, it just won't auto report the errors to my this page.

###**Libraries**

This application uses Octokit (http://octokit.github.io/) to auto report program errors.
