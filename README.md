# SomeCardGames

Built with Visual Studio, Some Card Games is a C# application with the power of the .net framework behind it, that allows you to play a few card games.

Release versions are not availible currently, but if you desperatly want to see where I am at in developing this, you can compile it yourself and see.

This application uses Octokit (http://octokit.github.io/) to auto report program errors.
